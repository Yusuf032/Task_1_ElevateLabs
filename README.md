# Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task is to clean and prepare raw data for Machine Learning models by performing preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling, and outlier detection.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📊 Steps Performed
1. Imported dataset and checked basic information (data types, null values).
2. Handled missing values using mean/median imputation.
3. Converted categorical features into numerical using encoding.
4. Normalized / standardized numerical features.
5. Detected and removed outliers using boxplots.
6. Prepared the final clean dataset for Machine Learning models.
